            depository system w.e.f September 01, 2020. 2) Update your e-mail and

            receive OTP directly from depository on your e-mail and/or mobile
            number to create pledge. 3) Check your securities / MF / bonds in the

            while dealing in securities markets - once KYC is done through a SEBI
            registered intermediary (broker, DP, Mutual Fund etc.), you need not
            undergo the same process again when you approach another
            intermediary." Dear Investor, if you are subscribing to an IPO, there
            is no need to issue a cheque. Please write the Bank account number and

            in your bank account. As a business we don't give stock tips, and have
            not authorized anyone to trade on behalf of others. If you find anyone
            claiming to be part of Zerodha and offering such services, please
